  Given an array of objects, where each object contains information about one of the drivers, render a list of cards where each card displays information about the drivers: full name, race number, team, total points, image. The list has to be shown in descending order based on their points.
  
  Each card should have 2 buttons, one that adds 5 points to the driver and one that subtracts 5, after modifying their points the changes should be visible in the UI.
  
  On the right side of the list render a card that only shows the name of the team with the most points and the images of the 2 drivers. (each team has 2 drivers, the team’s points are the sum of the points gathered by the 2 drivers). The component used to render this card must be the same that was used to render an individual card item in the descending order list.
  
  OPTIONAL – you were provided the country code of each driver, try also displaying the national flag in the driver card, the approach is up to you, external libraries are welcomed.
